An end-to-end clinical laboratory management software: payment control and test processing with the highest security standards, no matter where you are.

Flemik is the solution that captures data transmitted by a blood chemistry analyzer, encrypts it using the latest encryption technology, and sends it to our server which instantly transforms the analyzer data into understandable text for our clients. You can view this data on our website from any device and even convert it directly into a PDF file with a wide range of customizations to match your laboratory's standards. You can sign and digitally seal the PDF, and if desired, share it directly with the patient.
